## Nand2Tetris Hack Assembly UFAZ Computer Architecture Project Work 2
what a long title, huh...

In this app you control the character - you're the boss here.
How to run:

 1. Download the CPU Emulator for the Nand2Tetris Hack Assembly 
 2. Open the .asm file provided in the repository
 3. Ensure all animations are disabled
 4. Run

Use your keyboard's arrow keys to control the square
Square is 16x16 pixels
Screen in the emulator is 512x256
Meaning, there is a 32x16 grid for the square to move inside

I found this project much more engaging and productive compared to simple drawing in ASM or displaying predefined text by clicking a button. It gives more understanding on how the assembly works, because:

 1. If I were to draw predefined image, the image would be 10k+ characters, but no actual code except for "move this pixel to that address"
 2. In those projects are little to none keyboard interactions and those are always predictable
 3. In this project one can interacts with memory addresses which are not @SCREEN and @KBD
 4. One can actually make something bigger out of this = it has some potential

I have to rewrite this README, it's already 1AM, I dunno what I am writting about

If you do not know what was the project about:
"Draw a pattern on the screen (You can draw any pattern). You can after scrolling it,
make a simple animation and using the Keyboard to control it. If you have time try to
make a simple game (The project must be written in HACK assembly language)."
